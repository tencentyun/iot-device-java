# Product Overview

This repository contains two products: IoT Hub and IoT Explorer, each with the SDKs for Java and Android.

## IoT Hub SDKs for Java and Android

Tencent Cloud Internet of Things Hub (IoT Hub) aims to provide a secure, stable, and efficient connection platform that helps developers quickly achieve stable, high-concurrency, and omnidirectional data communications among devices, user applications, and cloud services at low costs. It can implement cross-device interaction, device data reporting, and configuration distribution. Further, by opening up the linkage between device data and Tencent Cloud services based on the rule engine, it allows for the storage, real-time computation, and smart processing and analysis of massive amounts of data with speed and ease. For more information, please see [IoT Hub](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/634).

This repository provides the IoT Hub device SDK. You can securely connect Java-enabled devices to IoT Hub by connecting their drivers to the SDK or connect Android-enabled devices to IoT Hub by integrating the SDK into them.
