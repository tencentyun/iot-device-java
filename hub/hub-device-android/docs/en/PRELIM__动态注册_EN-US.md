# Dynamic Registration Authentication
## Overview
This feature assigns the same key to all devices under the same product, and a device gets a device certificate/key through a registration request for authentication. You can burn the same configuration information for the same batch of devices. For more information on the three authentication schemes provided by IoT Hub, please see [Overview](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/634/35272). For more information on the dynamic registration request, please see [Dynamic Registration API Description](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/634/47225).

If you enable automatic device creation in the console, you don't need to create devices in advance, but you must guarantee that device names are unique under the same product ID, which are generally unique device identifiers (such as MAC address). This method is more flexible. If you disable it in the console, you must create devices in advance and enter the same device names during dynamic registration, which is more secure but less convenient.

## Running demo for dynamic registration
Before running the demo, you need to configure `PRODUCT_ID` (product ID), `DEVICE_NAME` (device name), and `PRODUCT_KEY` (`ProductSecret` in the console) in the [app-config.json](../../../hub-android-demo/src/main/assets/app-config.json) file.

Click **Dynamic Registration** in the basic feature module to call dynamic registration authentication. Below is the sample code:
```
TXMqttDynreg dynreg = new TXMqttDynreg(mProductID, mProductKey, mDevName, new SelfMqttDynregCallback());// Initialize `TXMqttDynreg`
dynreg.doDynamicRegister();// Call dynamic registration
```

The following logcat log represents the process in which dynamic device registration is authenticated successfully.
```
D/TXMQTT: Dynamic Register OK!
I/TXMQTT: Dynamic register OK! onGetDevicePSK, devicePSK[**********************] // The device is authenticated with key
I/TXMQTT: Dynamic register OK!onGetDeviceCert, deviceCert[**********************] devicePriv[**********************] // The device is authenticated with certificate
```

`TXMqttDynregCallback` is the callback for dynamic registration authentication.
```
/**
 * The device key is called back after dynamic registration authentication success (for key authentication)
 * @param devicePsk Device key (for key authentication)
 */
 @Override
 public void onGetDevicePSK(String devicePsk){}

/**
 * The device certificate content string and device private key content string are called back after dynamic registration authentication success (for certificate authentication)
 * @param deivceCert Device certificate content string
 * @param devicePriv Device private key content string
 */
 @Override
 public void onGetDeviceCert(String deviceCert, String devicePriv){}

/**
 * Callback for dynamic registration authentication failure
 * @param cause Exception
 * @param errMsg Failure information
 */
 @Override
 public void onFailedDynreg(Throwable cause, String errMsg){}

/**
 * Callback for dynamic registration authentication failure
 * @param cause Exception
 */
 @Override
 public void onFailedDynreg(Throwable cause){}
```
