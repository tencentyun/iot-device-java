# IoT Explorer Device SDK for Java
Welcome to the IoT Explorer device SDK for Java.

The IoT Explorer device SDK for Java works with the device data template defined by the platform to implement a framework for data interaction between devices and the cloud based on the data template protocol. You can quickly implement data interaction between devices and the platform as well as between devices and applications based on the framework. This document describes how to get and call the IoT Explorer SDK for Java. If you encounter any issues when using it, please [feel free to submit them at GitHub](https://github.com/tencentyun/iot-device-java/issues/new).

## Prerequisites
* Create a Tencent Cloud account and activate IoT Explorer in the Tencent Cloud console.
* Create project products and devices in the console and get the product ID, device name, device certificate (for certificate authentication), device private key (for certificate authentication), and device key (for key authentication), which are required for authentication of the devices when you connect them to the cloud. For detailed directions, please see [Project Management](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1081/40290), [Product Definition](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1081/34739), and [Device Debugging](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1081/34741).

## Project configuration
The SDK supports remote Maven dependencies and local source code dependencies. For more information on how to connect, please see [SDK Connection Description](docs/en/PRELIM__SDK接入说明_EN-US.md).

## Downloading the sample code of IoT Explorer SDK for Java demo
